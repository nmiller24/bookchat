This folder contains a series of prompts to help recreate the BookChat application from scratch. Follow these prompts in order to build a fully functional chat application with modern styling and GitHub integration.

## Prompt Order

0. `0_github_setup.txt` - Initial repository setup and GitHub configuration
1. `1_initial_setup.txt` - Basic server setup and project structure
2. `2_database_setup.txt` - Database implementation and API endpoints
3. `3_frontend_html.txt` - HTML structure and frontend layout
4. `4_styling.txt` - Modern CSS styling and animations
5. `5_javascript.txt` - Chat functionality implementation
6. `6_github_integration.txt` - Version control setup
7. `7_technical_specs.txt` - Detailed technical specifications and verification steps
8. `8_testing.txt` - Comprehensive test suite implementation
9. `9_advanced_setup.txt` - Production readiness, security, and best practices

## How to Use

1. Start with prompt 0 to set up your GitHub repository
2. Follow each subsequent prompt sequentially
3. Each prompt builds upon the previous ones
4. Use `7_technical_specs.txt` as a reference throughout the development process
5. Implement tests as you develop using `8_testing.txt` as a guide
6. Apply best practices from `9_advanced_setup.txt` as you build each component
7. Verify each component works before moving to the next prompt
